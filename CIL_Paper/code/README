alm_mc.m
method for completing a matrix based on the mc-alm method
parameters:
M - Matrix to be completed
nil - value representing the missing values in M
output:
L - The completed matrix

baseline_rpca
method for completing a matrix based on the rpca method
parameters:
M - Matrix to be completed
nil - value representing the missing values in M
output:
L - The low-rank part of the completed matrix
S - The sparse part of the completed matrix

baseline_svd
method for completing a matrix based on the svd method
parameters:
M - Matrix to be completed
nil - value representing the missing values in M

generateHotelData.m
Creates the data described in section II-E of the paper.
Parameters for the function:
user - number of users (rows)
hotel - number of hotels/items (columns)
user_groups - number of groups for users
groups - number of groups for hotels/items
attackers - number of attackers
sparse - sparsity of returned modified matrix (higher value -> less entries)
attack_groups - Vector [x y]
	x number of attacking groups
	y number of hotels involved in attacks
	constrained: x <= y <= hotel
output:
data - The complete user-hotel rating matrix
modData - The user-hotel rating matrix with added attacker rows and removed values (represented by -1)
